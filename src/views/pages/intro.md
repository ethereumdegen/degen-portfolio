## Introduction 

ENS Api is a high-availability data resource server for resolving Ethereum Name Service domains. 

The majority of applications for web3+ethereum support SIWE (sign-in with Ethereum).  Many users of ethereum register ENS domains for their accounts such as 'vitalik.eth' to point at their address such as  '0x3991acbbd3e6bf973295e1faad070de97289b4ca'.  

In practice, resolving ENS domains from scratch can be very difficult for website developers.  ENS Api makes domain-name resolution extremely simple with our REST api.
