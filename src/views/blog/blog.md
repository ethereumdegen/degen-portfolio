# Ethereum Degen's Blog

As part of my mission to build open-source resources for the web3 builder community, I will write blogs about my open-source projects here.  Feel free to fork and use my code to help you build for Ethereum. 

You will find templates for sign-in-with-ethereum using react, solidity token templates, and scripts for scraping chain events for building dapp frontends.  Github does't let us pin enough repos to the front page so at least we can do this.
